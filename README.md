# Keep-It-Alive
It’s Dangerous To Fight Alone! is a boss-rush game I created in just one month during a personal game jam with a friend. The theme of the jam was “Keep it Alive”, which inspired the core mechanic of the game.

You play as a fairy companion, tasked with keeping your hero alive in a tough battle against a single, challenging boss. Instead of directly controlling the hero, you guide them by commanding attacks, timing parries to deflect projectiles, and dodging incoming attacks.

Instructions and controls are included on the game’s itch.io page. Enjoy!
